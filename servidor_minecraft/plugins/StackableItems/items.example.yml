# MIN sets the minimum amount that everything will stack to, but will not override higher default values.
#   Ex: MIN: 2 would allow swords/armor/etc. to stack to 2, but dirt/cobble/etc would still stack to 64.
# MAX sets the maximum amount that everything will stack to, but will not override lower default values.
#   EX: MAX: 32 would allow dirt/cobble/etc to only stack to 32, but still allow tools to stack at 1 and snowballs to stack at 16.
